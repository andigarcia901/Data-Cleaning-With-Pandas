# Data Analytics - Data Cleaning with Pandas in Action

## INTRODUCTION

Now that we’ve spent some time learning about the capabilities of the Pandas library, we’ll have a chance to put it into action!  For this assignment, we’ll be working with a “dirty” data set of various types of cars.  By using the Pandas library, we’ll be able to view, modify, and clean this data set, ultimately exporting our “clean” data set as a new .csv file! 

This GitHub repository will include the “dirty” .csv data set, as well as a Jupyter Notebook outlining the user stories for this project.  Each user story will have a corresponding empty Python code block for you to submit your answer.  At the end of the project, you will have two `.csv` files: the original “dirty” data set, and your exported “clean” data set, as well as your completed Jupyter Notebook!

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP

1. Create a GitHub repository for this project.  Remember to use a Python .gitignore and add a README file!
2. Clone your repository down onto your computer
3. Download the `.zip` file from this **GitHub** repository
4. Unzip on your computer, and move the files `Pandas_Data_Cleaning_User_Stories.ipynb` and `dirty_cars_dataset.csv` into your own project folder
5. Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code
6. Select the file `Pandas_Data_Cleaning_User_Stories.ipynb`
7. Starting from the top of the page, begin working through each of the user stories using the corresponding code block
8. **Be sure to thoroughly test each code block before continuing to the next user story!**
9. Include your completed `.ipynb` and cleaned `.csv` files within your repository for submission!
